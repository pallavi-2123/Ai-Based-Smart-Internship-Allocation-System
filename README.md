## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Gmail account with App Password (for email functionality)

### Installation

1. **Install Required Packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configure Email Settings**

For Gmail, you need to create an App Password:
- Go to Google Account Settings
- Security → 2-Step Verification → App Passwords
- Generate a new app password for "Mail"
- Copy the 16-character password

Set environment variables:

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export MAIL_USERNAME="your-email@gmail.com"
export MAIL_PASSWORD="your-16-char-app-password"
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
set MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
set MAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:MAIL_USERNAME="your-email@gmail.com"
$env:MAIL_PASSWORD="your-16-char-app-password"
```

Alternatively, you can hardcode them in `app_enhanced.py` (lines 30-31):
```python
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = 'your-email@gmail.com'
app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = 'your-16-char-app-password'
```

3. **File Structure**

app.config['MAIL_PORT'] = 587
app.config['MAIL_USE_TLS'] = True
```

### Outlook/Hotmail
```python
app.config['MAIL_SERVER'] = 'smtp-mail.outlook.com'
app.config['MAIL_PORT'] = 587
app.config['MAIL_USE_TLS'] = True
```

### Yahoo
```python
app.config['MAIL_SERVER'] = 'smtp.mail.yahoo.com'
app.config['MAIL_PORT'] = 587
app.config['MAIL_USE_TLS'] = True
```

### Custom SMTP Server
```python
app.config['MAIL_SERVER'] = 'your-smtp-server.com'
app.config['MAIL_PORT'] = 587  # or 465 for SSL
app.config['MAIL_USE_TLS'] = True  # or MAIL_USE_SSL = True
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify Gmail App Password (not regular password)
3. Check spam folder for emails

- Add domain-specific keywords
- Include quantifiable achievements
- Use proper formatting and structure

### Allocation Not Working
- Ensure at least 1 student and 1 company exist
- Students must have complete profiles with resumes
- Companies must have added job positions
- Student's domain must match position domain
- Student's CGPA must meet minimum requirement
